Arduino Library for Dallas Temperature ICs
==========================================

Usage
-----

This library supports the following devices:
    DS18B20
    DS18S20 - Please note there appears to be an issue with this series.
    DS1822

You will need a pull-up resistor of about 5 KOhm between the 1-Wire data line
and your 5V power. If you are using the DS18B20, ground pins 1 and 3. The
centre pin is the data line '1-wire'.

We have included a "REQUIRESNEW" and "REQUIRESALARMS" definition. If you 
want to slim down the code feel free to use either of these by including
#define REQUIRESNEW or #define REQUIRESALARMS a the top of DallasTemperature.h
