	Note: This explaination is best viewed with a UTF-8 text viewer.

	To help explain what this function is doing, the following describes
	how to efficiently compute reductions modulo a base of the form (2ⁿ - b)
	where b is greater than zero and (b + 1)² <= 2ⁿ.

	Here we are interested in reducing the result of multiplying two
	numbers that are less than or equal to (2ⁿ - b - 1).  That is,
	multiplying numbers that have already been reduced.

	Given some x less than or equal to (2ⁿ - b - 1)², we want to find a
	y less than (2ⁿ - b) such that:

	    y ≡ x mod (2ⁿ - b)

	We know that for all integer values of k >= 0:

	    y ≡ x - k * (2ⁿ - b)
	      ≡ x - k * 2ⁿ + k * b

	In our case we choose k = ⌊x / 2ⁿ⌋ and then let:

	    w = (x mod 2ⁿ) + ⌊x / 2ⁿ⌋ * b

	The value w will either be the answer y or y can be obtained by
	repeatedly subtracting (2ⁿ - b) from w until it is less than (2ⁿ - b).
	At most b subtractions will be required.

	In our case b is 19 which is more subtractions than we would like to do,
	but we can handle that by performing the above reduction twice and then
	performing a single trial subtraction:

	    w = (x mod 2ⁿ) + ⌊x / 2ⁿ⌋ * b
	    y = (w mod 2ⁿ) + ⌊w / 2ⁿ⌋ * b
	    if y >= (2ⁿ - b)
	        y -= (2ⁿ - b)

	The value y is the answer we want for reducing x modulo (2ⁿ - b).
